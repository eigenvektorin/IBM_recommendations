## 1. Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In the coursce of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Program, I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make built recommendations about new articles they could like. 

To build the recommender system, the following steps were implemented:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis
II. Rank Based Recommendations
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations (Using NLP)
V. Matrix Factorization
